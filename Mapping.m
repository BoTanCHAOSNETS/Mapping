clear all;


%%%% Define the Map
% X range 
% Y range 
% Grid Size


%%%% Determine the Reflection Spot
% 16 spots, 24 angles on each spot, each angle cancel 8 layers, 16*24*8 = 3072 JADEs
% This part calculates reflection location of each JADE suface 


%%%% Moving Shift vector
% x-y coordination shift of each measurement spot
% orientation of each measurement spot
% need to think about how to synthesis the orientation information to each JADE surface


%%%% Synthesis Information
% extend the moving shift vector to 3072 size
% synthesis the map
